          <h2> Our Company </h2>
          <br>
          Our company was first founded in 1978. ​It began with a small group of people who loved chocolate,
          however, they didn’t want to enjoy the blissfulness of chocolate themselves - they wanted to share the chocolate,
          so that others could enjoy it too.
          Thus, Choc o’ lat was born. ​Our products are 100% natural,
          meaning that our ingredients aren't artificial. Our products are also handmade for better quality and flavour.
        </br>

          <h2> Our Values </h2>
          <br>
          Here at choc o’ lat, we believe that every child should have an equal chance at life.
          ​However, this isn’t the case in poorer, more corrupt countries. So to help make a difference,
          we donate 3% of every single product bought from our store and
          the money goes directly to the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG).
          Now you can enjoy our delicious products while knowing you’ve made a difference.
